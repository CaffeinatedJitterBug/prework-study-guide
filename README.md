# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## A study guide made during the prework phase of coding bootcamp

This website was created to act as a study guide for a coding bootcamp. It covers the basics of how to use Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Git/Git Bash. More notes will be added to the guide as the bootcamp progresses.

## Usage

The body of the website is divided into sections, one for each topic covered in the bootcamp. Each section contains detailed notes on everything that was covered during the prework as well as the course itself. The Javascript behind the site uses the DevTools console to log what topics are being covered, so be sure to check out the console for a demonstration of how that works.
